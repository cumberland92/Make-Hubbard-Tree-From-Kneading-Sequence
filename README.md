# Make-Hubbard-Tree-From-Kneading-Sequence
This takes in a string of 0s, 1s, and 2s and outputs an image of the Hubbard tree with that kneading sequence.
To learn more about Hubbard Trees and their kneading sequences see https://arxiv.org/pdf/0801.4662.pdf and *Continuous itinerary functions and dendrite maps* by Stewart Baldwin.
This program impliments Definition 3.18 of *Continuous itinerary functions and dendrite maps* in order to build a Hubbard tree from nothing more than its kneading sequence (a string of 0s, 1s, and 2s that begin 01^k2... and satisfies definition 2.18 of *Continuous itinerary functions*). 
All you need to do is type in a string and let the computer do the rest.
